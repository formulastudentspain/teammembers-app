# Formula Student Spain: Team members

This is a mobile application for both Android and iOS devices that will be used by the team members of the competition.

## Features

#### Timeline + push notifications (Coming soon)

A timeline with all the news and relevant information during the competition.

#### Chat + push notifications (Coming soon)

It is hard for us to find the teams to give them information, also it is hard for them to find a senior FSS staff to solve any of their problems. Here is a chat to avoid losing time and extra walking under the sun.

#### My team (Coming soon)

Scrutineering stickers are nice and we know they are cool for Instagram, but we want to be more eco-friendly and get rid of the paper inspection sheets. From now on, all the relevant information about the scrutineering process will be printed in the phones.

#### Teams information (Coming soon)

Do you want to know your competitors? Here you can find a list with all the teams that are participating in the competition.

#### Documents (Coming soon)
Stop searching in emails or web pages relevant documents. Handbook, briefings and results can be found here.

#### F.A.Q (Coming soon)
Just in case things are not clear enough.
